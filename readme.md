# Fullstack Workshop
The course plan focuses on hands-on work and provides 3 hours per unit for practical work on the realistic web application.
The participants should have a working understanding of developing Java Spring Boot or .NET-core based web apps and will build their skills with Node.js, GraphQL, React, and TypeScript.

## project ideas
- Google Form-Clone **(Recommended)**
- Onlineshop
- Doodle-Clone
- Twitter-Clone
- Todo-App
- Blog

## Unit 0: Individual Preparation (Before the course starts)
- WSL2 Ubuntu-22 installed
  - Node.JS LTS (v18) installed
- VSCode (or IntelliJ)
- DevContainer installed (prepared by us)
- [Clone the Repo from GitHub](https://github.com/tkowalski-exxeta/fullstack-workshop)

## Unit 1: React Project setup + CSS Layout + Router

## Unit 3: React and GraphQL Integration
- Integrating GraphQL into a React project using Apollo Client
- Updating the state with mutations

## Unit 4: Advanced TypeScript Types
- TypeScript basics review
- Introduction to discriminated union types
- Built-in helper classes in TypeScript (e.g. **Readonly**, **Partial**, etc.)
- Enhancing the React and GraphQL code with advanced TypeScript types

## Unit 5: Forms
- React Router: Protected routes with authentication and authorization
- Implementing forms in React
- Using React Hooks for form handling
- Form validation with libraries such as Formik or React Hook Form
- Edit-Functionality

## Unit 6: Testing + Accessibility
- React Testing Library
- Playwright
- Accessiblity

## Unit 7: Deployment and Production Considerations
- Google-Performance Metrics (Lighthouse)
- Performance optimization techniques
- Best practices for security and scaling
- Deploying a full-stack app to a hosting platform (e.g. Azure?)

## Unit 8: Conclusion and Presentation
- Review of the course topics
- Participants work on a final project, applying the concepts learned throughout the course
- Presentation of final projects and wrap up.
